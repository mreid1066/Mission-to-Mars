# Mission to Mars Challenge
## Project Overview

After completing the initial web app to scrape data from various websites, we were tasked with adding an additional function that would scrape images and titles from an additional site in order to add images of Mars' four hemispheres to the website using mongo db and flask.

## Challenges
Unfortunately, I really struggled with this challenge and was unable to complete it. However, I was able to more or less get Deliverable 1 complete except the images I was able to pull were thumb nails and not the requested .jpg files. I struggled getting the scraped information to the mongo db and did not update the index.html correctly. I feel awful about turning in such subpar work, but I wanted to turn in something.

I should have utilized my resources better this week and will set up a tutoring session in order to fully grasp the areas that I did not fully comprehend. I spent over 10 hours on this challenge and tried to make it work, but failed to meet the mark. Tomorrow starts off a new week and I fully intend on starting fresh, giving it my all and using all the available resources.
